# Analysis-of-Hospital-Pricing-Data
SQL and data warehousing project compiling and analyzing newly publicly available hospital pricing data. A relational database structure was developed for the storage of hospital data collected from publicly accessible sources, now available though the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hospital Price Transparency Rule which went into effect in 2021. Data was collected, cleaned, and stored in an Azure SQL database. This database was queried to characterize the scope and usefulness of the currently available data. 

This group project was completed as a course requirement for CSCI 5707 - Database Systems at the UMN. Group members include Destiny Ziebol, Abigail Slater, Tyson Reed, and Gavin Schaeferle. My (Destiny Ziebol) contributions included administering the Azure database, cleaning data from the essential hospital system, and assisting in querying, analyzing and writing the final paper.
